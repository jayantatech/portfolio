# React Portfolio

Welcome to my React-based portfolio project! This portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and provides information about me. It has been built using React, React Hooks, React Router, and various other features to create an interactive and responsive user experience.

## Features

- **React Components:** Utilizes the power of React to modularize the application and create reusable components.
- **React Hooks:** Leverages React Hooks for state management, making the codebase more organized and efficient.

- **React Router:** Implements React Router for navigation, allowing smooth transitions between different sections of the portfolio.

- **Lazy-loaded Images:** Enhances performance by implementing lazy loading for images using the `lazysizes` library.

- **Other Features:** Explore the codebase to discover additional features, including animations, responsive design, and more.
